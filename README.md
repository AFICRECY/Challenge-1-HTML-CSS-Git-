Horiseon specializes in SEO (Search Engine Optimization), Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. Additionally, this web app is desgined to be in line with assecibility standards, allowing both visually and audio impared individuals to access our resources as well. 

The world is changing. As companies or contractors attempt to grow their buisinesses and/or brands, they are finding that there is a definite need for an online presence. Without one, essentially companies greatly limit their exposure to smart phone and computer users all over the world. Online advertisement is responsible for roughly 62% of online purchases, and that percentage is increasing annualy. (https://www.statista.com/statistics/237974/online-advertising-spending-worldwide/) For those corporations who experience lawsuits or individuals who have had unwanted press about them online, online reputation management can completeley change popular news or media attention that would be either bad for buisiness or for the career and sucess of someone in that position. 

Through creating this web app, I was able to discover the required alt attributes which can aid in making accessible media files for visually and hearing impaired users. It was also found out that through reviewing and refactoring my code, I was able to consolidate the code to clean it up.
