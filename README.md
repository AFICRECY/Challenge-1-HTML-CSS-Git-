## Description: 

[Visit Deployed Site]: XXX

This website application serves as a online resource for any company, contractor, or individual, with an online presence, who would like either like to see more views on their advertisements, a change in their online reputation, or an increase in customers and viewers from around the world. Horiseon specializes in SEO (Search Engine Optimization), Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. Additionally, this web app is desgined to be in line with assecibility standards, allowing both visually and audio impared individuals to access our resources as well. 

The world is changing. As companies or contractors attempt to grow their buisinesses and/or brands, they are finding that there is a definite need for an online presence. Without one, essentially companies greatly limit their exposure to smart phone and computer users all over the world. Online advertisement is responsible for roughly 62% of online purchases, and that percentage is increasing annualy. (https://www.statista.com/statistics/237974/online-advertising-spending-worldwide/) For those corporations who experience lawsuits or individuals who have had unwanted press about them online, online reputation management can completeley change popular news or media attention that would be either bad for buisiness or for the career and sucess of someone in that position. 

Through creating this web app, I was able to discover the required alt attributes which can aid in making accessible media files for visually and hearing impaired users. It was also found out that through reviewing and refactoring my code, I was able to consolidate the code to clean it up.

#### Refactoring Examples:

Throughout the original code provided I was able to got into style.css and consolidate the code. I did this to many different classes and checked to make sure that the HTML elements and their respective classes matched with the style.css classes.

In this code sample I show the original classes that I consolidated by combining the two classes ".benefit-brand" and ".benefit-cost" into "benefit-lead" so there would only need to be one class (style.css line 92)


```
.benefit-lead {
    margin-bottom: 32px;
    color: #ffffff;
}
```


* I was able to add to the existing .header class which affected the tabs at the top of the page. I added a "display: inline-block" and a width of 100% so that the tabs at the top of the page would stay contained within the section and stay in line when the screen is adjusted. This feature should prove both beneficial to smart phone users as well desktop users. Below is a snippet of the old vs the new code. 





* I modified the title element on index.html. The original would not stand out to SEO readers and would not help include non-visual users who use software to scan for assecibility markers such as descriptive titles and headings.The new title is: "Online Presence Resource"

* I also added other more descriptive "Alt Attributes" on the image elements in HTML in an effort to 
aid in more accessibile and inclusive website experiences. A example is added below.
